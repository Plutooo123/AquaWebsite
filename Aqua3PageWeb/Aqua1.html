  <p>Here at Georgia Aquarium, we keep our animals safe and sound! We feed them everyday to make sure they are in perfect condition and health for vistors to look at them with no worries!</p>
<p>We try our very best to keep the aquarium clean! Vistors can are always permitted to touch the animals but make sure to clean your hands afterwards!</p>

<p>Sharks! Predators of the Deep is the newest exhibit added to the aquarium and is one of the largest shark exhibits in North America. The exhibit displays a deep tank that is home to apex predators where you will learn about all the challenges faced by the sharks and their role in the health of the ocean. There is a diving cage also available in this exhibit for visitors to interact with the sharks and a wading pool to walk with the rays and zebra sharks.</p></div>
